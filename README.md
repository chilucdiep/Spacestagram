## <a name="technologies"></a>Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- HTML
- SCSS
- [NASA's APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [React Intersection Observer](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer)
- [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)

## <a name="features"></a>App Features

- Users can browser through all the [NASA's astronomy pictures](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod/) on the feed page and give a "like" to as many as they want.
- Liked pictures will appear the in "Pictures you've liked" section of the feed page. The "unlike" action from the user will remove the picture from the section.
- A user can read more information about a specific picture (such as the picture's date, context, copyright, etc..) by going on the picture's details page.
- Each picture has a details page with a designated url that can be shared. All links created using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/). 
- The design of the app is responsive and can be viewed on all devices.
- The feed page loads additional pictures as the user scrolls down (infinite scroll implemented with [React Intersection Observer](https://github.com/thebuilder/react-intersection-observer)).
- A user's liked pictures to local storage so results will persist even if they leave the page.

## <a name="improvements"></a>Future Improvements

- Add a UI skeleton loading animation while user wait for NASAâ€™s API to return data.
